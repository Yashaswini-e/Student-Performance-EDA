# Student Performance Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a student performance dataset
to understand academic trends and factors affecting student grades.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Key Analysis Performed
- Initial data understanding and inspection
- Data cleaning and validation
- Visualization of final grade distribution
- Analysis of study time vs academic performance
- Grade progression analysis (G1, G2, G3)

## Key Insights
- Most students achieve mid-range final grades.
- Higher study time is generally associated with better academic performance.
- Student grades remain relatively stable across grading periods.

## Dataset
Student Performance Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
